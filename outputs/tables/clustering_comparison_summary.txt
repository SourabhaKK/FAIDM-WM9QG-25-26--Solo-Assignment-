CLUSTERING METHOD COMPARISON SUMMARY

K-Means (k=3):
- Clusters: 3
- Noise points: 0
- Silhouette: 0.082
- Cluster sizes: [3618, 1700, 4682]

DBSCAN Results (varying eps):

  eps=0.5: 0 clusters, 10000 noise points, silhouette=N/A
  eps=1.0: 2 clusters, 9508 noise points, silhouette=0.420
  eps=1.5: 11 clusters, 8004 noise points, silhouette=0.289
  eps=2.0: 21 clusters, 6664 noise points, silhouette=0.246
  eps=2.5: 4 clusters, 4831 noise points, silhouette=0.158

Key Findings:
1. DBSCAN is highly sensitive to eps parameter
2. Number of clusters varies dramatically with eps
3. Many points classified as "noise" (ungrouped)
4. Difficult to achieve stable 3-cluster solution
5. No clear healthcare interpretation of "noise" patients

Conclusion:
DBSCAN's sensitivity to parameters and production of "noise" points
makes it unsuitable for healthcare risk stratification. K-Means provides
stable, interpretable groupings that align with low/medium/high risk
categories. This empirical comparison justifies the K-Means choice.
