EMPIRICAL MODEL COMPARISON SUMMARY

Decision Tree (max_depth=5):
- Precision: 0.302
- Recall: 0.801
- ROC-AUC: 0.799

Logistic Regression:
- Precision: 0.341
- Recall: 0.761
- ROC-AUC: 0.818

Key Findings:
1. Performance difference is marginal (0.018 ROC-AUC difference)
2. Decision Tree slightly worse on ROC-AUC
3. Trade-off: Decision Tree gains ~-1.8% performance but loses interpretability

Conclusion:
The marginal performance gain does NOT justify the loss of interpretability
in a healthcare screening context. Logistic Regression remains the preferred choice.
